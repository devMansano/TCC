This project was carried out with the intention of assisting in the diagnosis of breast cancer using artificial intelligence.

Firstly, to make it compile, you need to download the Keras, TensorFLow, Cv2, Python - OS and Numpy libraries.

Use the codes below to download these libraries:

pip install keras

pip install tensorflow

pip install opencv-python

pip install numpy

After downloading these libraries, it will be necessary to create the environment, use the code provided below within the terminal to create this virtual environment.

Windows version:
python -m venv env_cnn

Linux/Mac version:
source env_cnn/bin/activate

After creating the environment, it will be necessary to compile the RNC and train it. After training, it needs to be tested, so prepare some separate images in the "Test" folder and start testing the Artificial Intelligence itself.
